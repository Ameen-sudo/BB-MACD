# BB MACD

BB MACD is an indicator for MT4 and MT5 by EarnForex.com. It works by calculating Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) and applying a sort of Bollinger Bands to it. The resulting plot is displayed inside the separate chart window to help you detect trend changes.

The indicator offers all types of MetaTrader alerts on color change events.
